Small Java platforming game
Made a while back to practice OOP design and just making games in general.
Doesn't obey a lot of OOP principles like data encapsulation but still works, I've gotten better at following them recently.
To play in Windows, run the .bat file.
Otherwise go into terminal and run the commands "javac \*.java" to compile and then "java Game" to run.
